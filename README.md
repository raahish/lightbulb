## What is LightBulb?

Lightbulb is a unique web platform for college campuses that connects people with ideas to the people who have the skill to implement them, at their specific universities. Users can approach the platform from two perspectives - either they have an idea and are looking for the right talent to execute it, or they do not have an idea but have skills that they would like to use working on other ideas. Lightbulb connects these two kinds of people together so that they can start working on the entrepreneurial projects they are passionate about.

The nature of the program is a platform that connects students with an idea to other students with the skill set to help them execute the idea.  This allows for an engineer with a new innovative idea to connect with a business-minded Comm School student or a Comm School student with an idea to connect with the exact Tech-minded coder needed to make his idea viable.  In this platform, users will be able to filter their search in order to find the exact right people that they are looking for.  If they don’t wish for a filtered search and would rather see all ideas and idea executors, they also have the option to see all of them.

## How it works

When users sign up onto the platform, they are asked to enter their skills while building their profile. Alternately, when users post an idea on Lightbulb, they are required to enter the skills they are looking for in order to execute the idea. Our algorithms automatically match people with the right skill set to the ideas that need them - allowing rapid team building, in turn, helping overcome the most fundamental problem that aspiring entrepreneurs face.

## Our Vision

The goal is to build a platform that solves the biggest obstacle and the most inefficient part of entrepreneurship: finding the right people to team up within a timely manner. Up until now, personal connections were the only route to finding a possible partner for a venture.  Little did these people realize, there was probably a student that was a perfect fit for the venture, they just haven’t met them yet.  Along with minimal access to perfect partner fits, it can take a long time for any meeting or discussion about teaming-up to happen.  This time lost is very precious, because the bright idea can soon fizzle out because of little progress and some discouragement.  Lightbulb seeks to make this process of finding partners efficient and timely, so the idea doesn’t lose its vigor in the early stages.
